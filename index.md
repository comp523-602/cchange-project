## Project Introduction

¢Change hopes to create a social sharing experience that makes it easy for people to publicly support the causes they care about and encourage their friends to do the same. The user experiences begins with posting a photo. With each photo post, users select a ongoing campaign sponsored by a ¢Change-approved charity, and are prompted to share this photo post on existing social networking profiles like Facebook and Twitter. The user's friends will see the user's photo attached to a small banner with the selected charity's logo and the name of the selected campaign.

Interested friends can following the accompanying link into ¢Change's mobile-friendly platform, where they are given options to make a micro-donation to the campaign their friend supports, learn more about the cause their friend is passionate about, and view the other causes their friend supports. If they are moved to donate, they'll need to set up an account, and will hopefully consider supporting other campaigns by creating their own post.

¢Change will invite a list of approved charities to create and maintain their own presence on the ¢Change application. Approved charities will be asked to post an update about how they're using the funds they receive on an ongoing basis. Each charity will have an interface they can use to setup and manage their profile, create and manage campaigns, and post updates. Charities will also have passive and active control measures over the content that is publicly associated with their brand.
