# Users 18-25
**Persona:** Students or people just entering the workforce who are likely to learn about ¢change by seeing their friends or followers making posts with the ¢change banner. They are drawn to ¢change because they view it as an easy way to communicate their concern about current events and to let their friends know where they stand on pressing issues.

**Story (18-year old college freshman):** "I'm tired of hearing about how we're all doomed and the world is going to shit.  I want to do something, even if it's a little something, to make the world better. ¢Change helps me find the organizations that are doing important work, whether in the area of climate change, racial justice, the food system, fracking, etc. It motivates me to elevate my posts, so that friends or even strangers might be inspired to give to great organizations that are committed to the causes I care about. If my post inspires others to give, then my impact with 5¢ can grow to thousands of dollars. That makes me feel like I'm doing something more than waiting for the world to implode."

**Use Case:**
* Jonathan is on a social media platform and he starts to notice some users adding banners to their posts. He also sees a couple of the organizations that he follows reposting posts that were dedicated to them, thanking the people for aiding them in their efforts.
* He is curious what this is all about, so he goes to ¢change to check it out. When he goes to the site he is able to browse the non-profits and their programs without signing up, which he likes. 
* He notices that when he looks up a non-profit that he already knows, there are suggestions for other non-profits that he might like also. Quickly he learns about work that is being done that is inspiring to him that he had never heard about before. 
* He decides to sign up because he can support all of these causes without breaking the bank or being harassed for more money over email.
* Jonathan bookmarks some of these initiatives that he is leaning about so that he can find them easily when he decides to make his first post with a donation.
* He spends a little time looking for people he knows who are also using the app. He also invites a couple of friends to try it that he thinks might like it too. (Maybe when he invites someone and they sign up, he gets $1 in his account as a thank you?)

**Persona:** This is someone who uses social media platforms somewhat to a great deal. They probably follow some non-profits or more socially/eco conscious folks on Facebook or Instagram. They would be drawn to ¢change because perhaps they have guilt for not doing more to contribute to issues that they want to see eradicated, but never feel that they the have extra income to make a significant donation. This is the first time they have seen an option for micro donating and that appeals to them.

**Story (38-year old Program Manager at 350.org):** "We're still financially dependent on corporations, large foundations, and wealthy individuals to fund our work.  Even to become a 'Climate Defender,' the minimum donation is $9/mo.  ¢Change allows us to accept smaller donations from a larger base of the age cohort that comprises our activists. So, instead of appealing to one group for fund raising (wealthy donors) and another for activism (young adults 16-35), ¢Change gives us a new avenue to engage more deeply with our target audience.  Because their finance model aggregates micro-donations, we don't have to deal to the administrative challenge of small donors.  Instead we get an annual charitable gift summary on 12/1, and they handle the receipt to donors for tax purposes. All we have to do is post activities and events and repost some of the photos that generate the highest collective giving."

# Users 40-60
Persona: These are folks who maybe use Facebook, but might not use other social media platforms as much. They are long time supporters or have recently become supporters of different non-profit organizations. They get an email from the organizations they support, telling them about ¢change. The organizations assure them that ¢change has a secure banking system and that it has their seal of approval. Maybe most of these people don't think about it much, maybe they tell their kids about it. The next time there is a current event crisis that relates to one of the non-profits they support, they get another email asking them to help, and using ¢change is one of the ways they can do that.

**Story (46-year old High School English Teacher):** "My students ask me what they can do.  They're beyond being angry and I haven't know wht to offer them.  ¢Change is a way to learn about all the great things that are happening in the world that the mass media and even social media rarely talk about.  They have no idea that there's an NGO in Tanzania called Apopo that has trained rats to sniff our landmines.  It is saving thousands of lives and maimings ever year.  In fact, there are over two million great organizations that are helping improve life on Earth.  ¢Change is fun to browse and learn about those worthy organizations.  They can make a nominal donation and perhaps they will find themselves working for one of these great organizations later in life."

**Use Case:**
* Tomas decides to look at the ¢change website, even though he is still dubious about it's security.  He accepts the non-profits invitation and is directed to their page. There he can see testimonials from people about the site who are long time supporters of this organization. (something like that...)
* He is really impressed by how many organizations are represented, how the selection is curated and by how much money is actually being raised for these organizations. 
* Tomas decides to join, even if he doesn't think he will use it that often. He does think his kids might though since they are using social media all of the time. He decides to invite them and gift them each $20 into their account, which he does via ¢change.
* He makes a post on Facebook with a  ¢change banner and he gets comments and compliments from other people for it. He continues to use ¢change and he continues to give people he knows funds towards building their donation history as gifts.
