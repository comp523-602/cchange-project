## Project Concept

¢Change hopes to create a social sharing experience that makes it easy for people to publicly support the causes they care about and encourage their friends to do the same. The user experiences begins with posting a photo. With each photo post, users select a ongoing campaign sponsored by a ¢Change-approved charity, and are prompted to share this photo post on existing social networking profiles like Facebook and Twitter. The user's friends will see the user's photo attached to a small banner with the selected charity's logo and the name of the selected campaign.

Interested friends can following the accompanying link into ¢Change's mobile-friendly platform, where they are given options to make a micro-donation to the campaign their friend supports, learn more about the cause their friend is passionate about, and view the other causes their friend supports. If they are moved to donate, they'll need to set up an account, and will hopefully consider supporting other campaigns by creating their own post.

¢Change will invite a list of approved charities to create and maintain their own presence on the ¢Change application. Approved charities will be asked to post an update about how they're using the funds they receive on an ongoing basis. Each charity will have an interface they can use to setup and manage their profile, create and manage campaigns, and post updates. Charities will also have passive and active control measures over the content that is publicly associated with their brand.

¢Change is a photo filter app that uses micro-donations to share awareness, support non-profit organizations and effortlessly make an impact.

## Personas

### Users 18-25

**Persona:**
Students or people just entering the workforce who are likely to learn about ¢change by seeing their friends or followers making posts with the ¢change banner. They are drawn to ¢change because they view it as an easy way to communicate their concern about current events and to let their friends know where they stand on pressing issues.

**Story**
\(18-year old college freshman): “I’m tired of hearing about how we’re all doomed and the world is going to shit. I want to do something, even if it’s a little something, to make the world better. ¢Change helps me find the organizations that are doing important work, whether in the area of climate change, racial justice, the food system, fracking, etc. It motivates me to elevate my posts, so that friends or even strangers might be inspired to give to great organizations that are committed to the causes I care about. If my post inspires others to give, then my impact with 5¢ can grow to thousands of dollars. That makes me feel like I’m doing something more than waiting for the world to implode.”

### Users 25-40

**Persona:**
This is someone who uses social media platforms somewhat to a great deal. They probably follow some non-profits or more socially/eco conscious folks on Facebook or Instagram. They would be drawn to ¢change because perhaps they have guilt for not doing more to contribute to issues that they want to see eradicated, but never feel that they the have extra income to make a significant donation. This is the first time they have seen an option for micro donating and that appeals to them.

**Story**
\(38-year old Program Manager at 350.org): “We’re still financially dependent on corporations, large foundations, and wealthy individuals to fund our work. Even to become a ‘Climate Defender,’ the minimum donation is $9/mo. ¢Change allows us to accept smaller donations from a larger base of the age cohort that comprises our activists. So, instead of appealing to one group for fund raising (wealthy donors) and another for activism (young adults 16-35), ¢Change gives us a new avenue to engage more deeply with our target audience. Because their finance model aggregates micro-donations, we don’t have to deal to the administrative challenge of small donors. Instead we get an annual charitable gift summary on 12/1, and they handle the receipt to donors for tax purposes. All we have to do is post activities and events and repost some of the photos that generate the highest collective giving.”

### Users 40-60

**Persona:**
These are folks who maybe use Facebook, but might not use other social media platforms as much. They are long time supporters or have recently become supporters of different non-profit organizations. They get an email from the organizations they support, telling them about ¢change. The organizations assure them that ¢change has a secure banking system and that it has their seal of approval. Maybe most of these people don’t think about it much, maybe they tell their kids about it. The next time there is a current event crisis that relates to one of the non-profits they support, they get another email asking them to help, and using ¢change is one of the ways they can do that.

**Story**
\(46-year old High School English Teacher): “My students ask me what they can do. They’re beyond being angry and I haven’t know wht to offer them. ¢Change is a way to learn about all the great things that are happening in the world that the mass media and even social media rarely talk about. They have no idea that there’s an NGO in Tanzania called Apopo that has trained rats to sniff our landmines. It is saving thousands of lives and maimings ever year. In fact, there are over two million great organizations that are helping improve life on Earth. ¢Change is fun to browse and learn about those worthy organizations. They can make a nominal donation and perhaps they will find themselves working for one of these great organizations later in life.”

## Environment

### Platform Selection

**React**
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library maintained by Facebook that handles the binding model data to HTML components. This platform was chosen because it runs in the browser but can also be compiled into native mobile applications - this functionality is important to allow users to view posts on the web without needing to download an application. Because of time constraints, native applications will not be compiled this semester, but the client can choose to compile these later.

**[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) CDN**
Cloudinary is a free Content Distribution Network which provides pre-build tools for image uploads, storage and management. Cloudinary accepts images from our client application and returns a URL which is sent to our API upon receipt.

**[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/)**
NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime engine that runs on UNIX systems. Express is a library which listens to a IP/port combination and accepts and responds to HTTP requests. This platform was chosen because of the broad availability of well-documented plugins which can expedite development and because it shortens the learning curve between front-end and back-end codebases.

**[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)**
MongoDB is a NoSQL relational database that can be hosted on UNIX systems. Mongoose is a JavaScript library that provides interfaces between NodeJS programs and a MongoDB instance. This platform was chosen because its object storage mirrors the same format of JSON, which is the object-notation our server application uses.

### Server Selection

Our project website is hosted with Github Pages.

Our API, administration panel, application, documentation and database are all served from a virtual Ubuntu machine which our client rents from a service called [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This server has a dedicated IP address. HTTP Requests made to this server are handled using [Apache's HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/). Apache routes individual subdomains to individual ports or static directories for each of our deployed tools.

### Development Environment

Our team is using GitHub's IDE tools (Github desktop and/or Atom). These tools have consistent syntax highlighting and visually represent the version-control status of our projects.
